It is a graphical front end to the telnet interface on DXLink devices.  It allows you to do almost all telnet commands with ease, from a friendly graphical interface.\r\n\r\nIt includes the following features:\r\n* Detecting when a DXLink device receives a DHCP address.\r\n* Collect information on DXLink devices for an entire subnet.\r\n* Quickly configure multiple DXLink devices to connect to a master, check firmware version loaded and current configuration.\r\n* Use “send command” on a single device or multiple devices at once.\r\n\r\nWe have had a number of requests for it to be released to the public. So the program is being released open source, and you can modify the code to meet your needs.\r\n\r\n**If this sounds like something that you would be interested in, head over to our github page at http://github.com/AMXAUNZ/Magic-DXLink-Configurator/releases**\r\n\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
